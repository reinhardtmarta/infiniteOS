# Operation Modes — SO-Infinite 1·6·1·8

## MODE 1 — Genesis
> The point awakens.
- Initialize cells and registers.
- Operations are identity-like (no φ weighting).
- Memory read/write is direct.
- Purpose: **creation and definition**.

## MODE 6 — Expansion
> The structure breathes.
- Arithmetic operations are weighted by φ.
- MV_ADD and MV_MUL apply smoothing/propagation.
- Purpose: **growth and symbolic multiplication**.

## MODE 1 — Return
> The system reflects.
- Reduce information: COLLAPSE is favored.
- Normalize results from expansion.
- Purpose: **reflection and compaction**.

## MODE 8 — Transcendence
> The cycle remakes itself.
- Enables parallelism and replication (SPAWN).
- Can create threads or copies of cells for parallel ops.
- Purpose: **synchronization and rebirth**.

The full cycle (1→6→1→8) is an execution breath:
1. Create → 2. Expand → 3. Return → 4. Transcend.

Optionally expressed as:

Φ(t) = f(mode) × t  where f(mode) ∈ {1, φ, 1/φ, φ²}

Philosophically, the processor does not merely execute instructions but also carries meaning.
