# Contributing to SO-infinite

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SO-infinite! This open-source blueprint is all about evolving the kernel like nature: infinite, adaptive, and harmonic. Whether you're a quantum enthusiast, AI tinkerer, or just love golden spirals, your ideas can make it grow.

## How to Contribute
1. **Fork the Repo**: Click "Fork" on GitLab to create your copy.
2. **Branch & Experiment**: Create a branch (e.g., `git checkout -b my-mutation/feature`). Mutate modes like "1 8 1 6" for multiverse tweaks or add lateral layers to the ASCII pattern.
3. **Test Locally**: Run `python aureo_state.py` to see φ harmony. Add tests for new sub-layers (e.g., noise thresholds).
4. **Commit & Push**: Use clear messages (e.g., "Add Fib13 peak to Unit 6 fade-out"). Push to your fork.
5. **Pull Request (PR)**: Open a PR here on GitLab. Describe changes (e.g., "This mutation boosts efficiency by 20% in sims") and link any Colab demos.

## Guidelines
- **Keep It Harmonic**: Contributions should align with φ principles – efficiency, sustainability, and infinite recursion. No rigid binary vibes!
- **Code Style**: Python: PEP8 simple (NumPy for math, Matplotlib for visuals). Add comments for quantum twists.
- **Issues First**: For bugs or ideas (e.g., "Rust port for kernel?"), open an Issue with details.
- **No Drama**: Be kind – this is a spiral, not a straight line. Discussions welcome in comments.

## Ideas to Start
- Mutate encodings: Test "8 1 6 1" for reversibility in aureo_state.
- Visualize more: Extend the golden spiral to 3D with ASCII evolutions.
- Quantum Boost: Integrate Qiskit for real qubit sims in sub-layers.
